Data: Some of the data I have uploaded in the repo, I used Image data set for pneumonia and malaria.                                                                                                                                                                           
Malaria dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria                                                                                                     
Pneummonia dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia                                                                                                                       
Note: I recommend to run all the models before running the project because I'm not uploading the saved weights into repo because, The saved files are trained according to my laptop configuration and my library versions, they might not compatable with your library versions.
